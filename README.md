### Introduction
This webpage is a simple demonstration of the works I've done since last month. The webpage consists of a Google Map and three buttons.
Clicking on the different buttons will draw different areas on the map, and a alert message will inform the user about the information of the area.


The webpage is implemented using Google Maps Javascript APIv3.
